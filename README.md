## scope
To describe and analyse of the Tips dataset. Fundamentals of data analysis module project 2019
[See here for instructions](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/project-2019-fundda/raw/master/project.pdf)
## Table of Contents
1. Overview of Project
2. Description of the tips dataset
3. Regression of dataset to determine if a relationship between total bill and tip amount exists
4. Further analysis of the tips dataset

## Overview of project
The purpose of this project is to use jupyter and seaborn to describe and analyse the tips dataset and hence improve my understanding of data analysis and two of the pyhton packages very often used to analyse and present the data. The project will firstly create a jupyter notebook and uses descriptive statistics to describe the tips data set. It will then use a statistical method called regression to discuss and nalyses if there is a relationship between two variables in the tips dataset (Tota bill and Tip). Finally, the project will extend the above to analyse other possible relationships with the dataset

## Description of the dataset
The tips dataset is a well known dataset consisting of information recorded by a waiter about each tip he received over a period of a few months working in one restaurant. This data consisted of 7 variables (Total bill, Tip, Gender(Sex), Smoker(Y/N), Day, Time and Size (Party size)). This dataset has been used as a good basis to learn and understand statistics and analysis of data. The raw data collected for the tips dataset can be seen [here](/Data/tips.csv).
