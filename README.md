## scope
To describe and analyse of the Tips dataset. Fundamentals of data analysis module project 2019
[See here for instructions](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/project-2019-fundda/raw/master/project.pdf)
## Table of Contents
1. Overview of Project
2. Description of the tips dataset
3. Regression of dataset to determine if a relationship between total bill and tip amount exists
4. Further analysis of the tips dataset

## Overview of project
The purpose of this project is to use jupyter and seaborn to describe and analyse the tips dataset. Jupyter is a python package used to present code and plots all in one browser environment, making it a very useful tool for presenting and sharing work done in python. Seaborn is a statistical package also in python used for completing many statistical operations. The project will firstly create a jupyter notebook that uses descriptive statistics to describe the tips data set. It will then use a statistical method called regression to discuss and analyse if there is a relationship between two variables in the tips dataset (Tota bill and Tip). Finally, the project will extend the above to analyse other possible relationships within the dataset

## Description of the dataset
The tips dataset is a well known dataset consisting of information recorded by a waiter about each tip he received over a period of a few months working in one restaurant. This data consisted of 7 variables (Total bill, Tip, Gender(Sex), Smoker(Y/N), Day, Time and Size (Party size)). This dataset has been used as a good basis to learn and understand statistics and analysis of data. The raw data collected for the tips dataset can be seen [here](/Data/tips.csv).
